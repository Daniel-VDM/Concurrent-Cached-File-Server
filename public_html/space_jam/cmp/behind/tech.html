<font size="+1"><B>THE
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND TO SPACE JAM</b><BR>
by Bill Warren</font><br>
<br>
Ivan Reitman is known as the director of such hit comedies as <i>Twins,
Stripes</i> and <i>Dave</i>, but in his busy career, he has returned again and
again to technically challenging projects.  He produced <i>They Came from
Within, </i>the first David Cronenberg movie to get wide release; it involved
creepy parasites.  Reitman also produced <i>Heavy Metal, </i>one of the first
feature cartoons aimed primarily at adult audiences.  And, of course, there was
<i>Ghostbusters </i>and its sequel, the worldwide hits that he both produced
and directed--and which opened many doors to new kinds of special effects.
<P><IMG align=right src="img/tech/tech1.jpg" width=180 height=108 alt="Daffy and Michael" hspace=10>
So it's hardly surprising that Reitman has now produced Warner Bros.' first
release through its new Feature Animation division: <i>Space Jam</i>, directed
by Joe Pytka.  It is also the first feature film in history to combine such a
large amount of traditional cartoon animation, live action and
three-dimensional computer graphics.  <i>Space Jam</i> stars sports superstar
Michael Jordan as well as Bugs Bunny, the Looney Tunes, Wayne Knight, Theresa
Randle.  Cameos are played by Bill Murray, former Boston Celtics great Larry
Bird, and NBA stars Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkely, Muggsy Bogues, Larry
Johnson and Shawn Bradley.  Reitman's long-time associates, Joe Medjuck and
Dan Goldberg, produce with him.
<P>The animation segments, produced through Warner Bros Feature Animation, are
co-directed by Bruce Smith and Tony Cervone, and the animation producer is Ron
Tippe.  The post-production and computer visual effects were created by
Cinesite, a Hollywood facility specializing in digital dazzle and sophisticated
effects, whose founder, Ed Jones, received an Academy Award for his work on
<i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i>
<p>So what does this exotic hybrid of computers, artists and actors require
from the filmmakers and their crews?<p>
When moviegoers think of "computer animation," they are most likely without a
clear idea of what that term really means.  Many may assume that a computer
scientist sits in front of a console, types in the words "Bugs Bunny" and
"Daffy Duck," chooses plot option C-27, and the setting "Mars."  He presses
"enter" and goes out for a cup of coffee.  He comes back an hour later to find
a seven-minute cartoon sticking out of the side of the computer. <p>
Well, that's <i>not</i> all, folks.  That's not even <i>close, </i>folks--for
the artist is never out of the loop.  As computer-intensive as it is, even
<i>Space Jam</i> began with talented animators drawing some of the most famous
cartoon characters in the world in the usual way: with pencil on paper.  What
happens after that is the technical story behind <i>Space Jam</i>.

<br>
<B>PUTTING REAL LIFE INTO THE CARTOON WORLD</B>
<P><IMG align=left src="img/tech/tech2.jpg" width=96 height=144 alt="Michael" hspace=10>Combining live human performers with cartoon characters goes back to almost the
very birth of cartoons.  In 1906, J. Stuart Blackton's <i>Humorous Phases of
Funny Faces </i>featured a live cartoonist creating moving drawings on a
blackboard.  At the climax of Winsor McKay's famous <i>Gertie the Dinosaur
</i>(1909), the delightful Gertie picks up her human creator and carries him
off.  Walt Disney began his career with a series of shorts in which a little
girl named Alice--a live entertainer, shot on standard film--frolicked with
cartoon animals. <p>
Over the years, there were other brief attempts at combining live action and
cartoons; Disney returned to it with <i>Song of the South </i>in 1949.  At
Warner Bros. the same year, in <i>My Dream is Yours</i>, Doris Day and Jack
Carson scampered through a little boy's dream, performing with the
Oscar-winning rabbit, Bugs Bunny.  At MGM, Gene Kelly and Esther Williams
performed with that studio's most famous characters, Tom &amp; Jerry--Kelly in
<i>Anchors Aweigh </i>(1945), Williams in <i>Dangerous When Wet </i>(1953).
And back at Disney, the 1964 hit, <i>Mary Poppins, </i>sent Julie Andrews and
Dick Van Dyke on a jolly holiday with animated penguins and street
entertainers.<p>
Although those sequences were spectacular and entertaining, it wasn't until the
Amblin/Disney production of <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit? </i>in 1988 that anyone
tried to combine animated characters and live-action actors throughout a
feature-length movie.<p>
As dazzling and technically sophisticated as <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?
</i>certainly was, that was then and this is now.  As Tony Cervone puts it,
"<i>Roger Rabbit </i>was the vinyl LP and this is the compact disc."  <i>Space
Jam</i> has leapfrogged ahead in the realm of combining live action and
cartoons, by tapping the talents of <i>Roger Rabbit </i>innovator Ed Jones and
other gifted effects and animation experts.  <p>
Wendy Aylsworth, Vice President of Technology and Facilities for Warner Bros.
Feature Animation, points out the differences.  "Everything in <i>Roger Rabbit
</i>was shot to film, then the pieces of film were combined.  But with today's
technology, we can now have all of the animation colored in the computer; the
original live-action footage is also scanned into the computer, and of course
the three-dimensional aspects are created in the computer.  So all of the
individual elements for <i>Space Jam </i>can come together in the computer;
each individual element can be modified in color and brightness and lighting
and texture to make it all mesh seamlessly."<p>
As Tony Cervone says, "I don't think any picture has combined so many different
media as <i>Space Jam</i> has."  Bruce Smith adds, "And all are interchangeable
at different times, so it's not one medium with another constantly.  There's
animation with the CG [computer graphics] environment, it's animation in the
traditional environment, it's live action in the CG environment, and live
action with the animated environment."

<P><B>TECHNOLOGY SHAPES ART</B>
<P><IMG align=right src="img/tech/tech3.jpg" width=144 height=87 alt="Bugs" hspace=10>Almost all the advances seen on the screen are due to the amazingly rapid
progress in the application of computers to the field of animation--in fact, to
virtually every aspect of <i>Space Jam</i>.  Early in the film, after we've met
Michael Jordan, the camera pans upward and the standard live-action world is
left behind as we see a miniature rooftop; the camera moves higher to a
computer-created sky and the Nerdlucks' home planet.  <p>
Moving closer to this "3-D" world, the camera passes into a giant carved mouth
and ends on a scene of classic cartoon (or "2-D") animation.  In what looks
like one unbroken camera movement, we move from the realm of reality to
miniatures to computer graphics and finally to cartoon animation.  (The use of
the term "3-D" here differs from the old 3-D used in Warner Bros.' classic
<i>House of Wax</i>: audiences won't dodge basketballs flying off the screen.
Here, it means simply the realm of computer graphics which have a more solid,
dimensional look than flat, "2-D" cartoon animation.)<p>
Movies run at 24 frames per second, but most cartoon features are shot "on
twos," meaning that one drawing is repeated for two frames. Therefore, there
are 12 individual drawings for each second in the usual Hollywood cartoon.  <p>
However, it's true that in any feature, a lot of the animation is shot "on
ones" -- 24 new drawings per second, just like the number of frames used to
film live action.  This is usually done for fast action or other moments where
fluidity and clarity of action are important, or, as with <i>Space Jam</i>,
when cartoons and live actors appear together and must coordinate their
motion,reactions and postions.  On <i>Space Jam,</i> all of this animation was
done by hand by the animators of the film. <p>
In addition to the state-of-the-art computers and animation techniques, other
cutting-edge technology was used in "Space Jam."  Most movies that blend
effects into footage shot with a moving camera use variations on the "motion
control" system originally developed for <i>Star Wars.  </i>A computer is
attached to the camera so that it can remember the precise moves the camera
made, and can reproduce them when the effects team adds other elements to the
scene.  Or a camera computer can "encode" the movements of the camera even if
it is being moved by a human operator.<p>
Says director Joe Pytka, "We used the best equipment, as well as the best ideas
we could come up with, to make <i>Space Jam</i> a movie worth watching.  As
technology continues to evolve, audiences know what to watch for and they
develop certain expectations.  our goal was to stay two steps ahead of their
expectations -- we're <i>setting </i>expectations with this movie."

<P><B>BEING GREEN</B>
<P><IMG align=right src="img/tech/tech4.jpg" width=115 height=180 alt="Michael against the green men" hspace=10>
One of the problems in filming actors working with cartoon characters who are
added later is that it's very hard for anyone to visually focus on an empty
space three feet in front of them that will later be filled with a talking
duck.  Try it yourself: it's nearly impossible.  The result is that the human
beings rarely seem to be looking directly at the cartoon characters.  Even if
audiences don't notice this consciously, it's a kind of unconscious static that
interferes with the belief that all this is really happening. <p>
Reitman, director Joe Pytka and Ed Jones, the founder and head of Cinesite,
came up with an ingenious solution to this problem--and their solution solves
several other problems as well.  It involves the use of a lot of green walls,
green floors, and actors from the Groundlings improvisation comedy troupe
covered all but for their eyes in clothing of the same green color.  In fact,
if you'd been on the set of <i>Space Jam</i>, you'd have seen the nearly
surreal sight of Michael Jordan vigorously playing basketball in a green gym
with a bunch of green people, some of whom scamper about in crouched-over
positions.  Other than Jordan himself, the only colors you could see other than
green would have been the basketball net and its backboard--and regularly-spaced
red balls and dots in a square grid all over the floors and walls.  But that's
not what you'll see in the finished film.<p>
Joe Pytka loves strong, forceful camera moves; Michael Jordan is, of course, an
athlete who expresses himself best through movement--and it can rarely be
rehearsed in the way an acting performance is.  As Ed Jones says, "We had to
shoot Michael being inventive, and Michael's only inventive one time--the camera
had better be ready to capture it."  Spontaneity was the rule of the day, but
cartoons, by their very nature, are, of course, totally controlled by the
artists.  The challenge was to combine Pytka's needs and Jordan's abilities
with the cartoons.  The solution was that green room and those red dots. 
<a name="oaks"></a>
<P><HR size=3 width=75%>
<P><B>TO SHERMAN OAKS -- AND BEYOND</B><br>
<br>
Because of the complex nature and relatively short production schedule of
<i>Space Jam</i>, in addition to the team at the Warner Bros. Feature Animation
facility in Sherman Oaks and the team in the company's London studio, the
production recruited a select group of animation studios all over the world.
Ultimately, everything was sent to <i>Space Jam</i>'s Sherman Oaks
headquarters, where all the drawings were scanned into computers and digitally
transmitted, via fiber-optic cables, to Cinesite's computers for compositing.
<p>
The involvement of computers on <i>Space Jam</i> began immediately after the
animators completed their drawings, and the background painters their work.
These were scanned into digital computer memory by using Cambridge Animation's
powerful and versatile Animo software program, used to complete the next
several stages of work.  <p>
<P><IMG align=left src="img/tech/tech5.jpg" width=180 height=108 alt="Michael with Tune Squad" hspace=10>The ink and paint department no longer uses real ink and real paint; instead,
using the Animo program, they call up the animators' drawings, one frame at a
time, onto a computer screen.  The expressive pencil lines of the animators are
temporarily replaced by very thin lines the computer creates--it even completes
lines when the artist has, for purposes of delineation, left them broken.<p>
Using color models created by art director Bill Perkins and his staff, the
"painter" employs Animo's built-in palette to color each of the animated
characters on the computer screen in flat, bright colors, much like a standard
seven-minute cartoon.  For the classic Looney Tunes gang, this was, of course,
the colors established over years of use; for the Nerdlucks, Monstars and
Swackhammer, the colors are, of course, new.  <p>
One of the most interesting features of Animo is that it allows the colors to
be changed at will.  Once a sequence is fully colored, if the directors or art
director want the characters changed, this can be done with a few strokes on
the keyboard.  For example, if a scene originally colored for daylight becomes
a nighttime scene instead, they can replace all of the bright colors with
darker tones.  <p>
Animation producer Ron Tippe points out the advantages.  "If you compare the
traditional ink-and-paint process of Xeroxing the artwork onto cels and
painting it by hand, there's a great savings in time.  With original cel paint,
very often only one or two colors at a time could be painted.  You would then
have to wait for those colors to dry, and then repaint it, so it was a very
exhausting process."  Wendy Aylsworth adds, "We're averaging about 4 minutes
for every cel that's painted.  Traditionally, if you hand-painted that stuff on
acetate, it's more like 20 to 30 minutes per cel." <p>
When all the coloring is done, the original pencil lines are restored; the
flow, the thickness, the manipulation of the line that often adds so much to an
animated character is back where it should be.  If these lines need their own
color changed, from the gray of pencil to, say, bold red for a dramatic effect,
this can be done as well, without ever losing the characteristics of the
animators' original drawings.  With traditional animation, the color had to be
scraped off each individual cel. <p>
These technical innovations give shape and life to the Looney Tunes characters,
but of course, there's more to <i>Space Jam</i> than a class reunion of Bugs,
Daffy and their pals.  There are live actors in the animated world, and
animated characters in the real world.<p>
Because so much of <i>Space Jam</i> takes place in the "real world," the
drawings needed a further boost than is given in most cartoons: they needed to
look as though they were being lit by movie lights.  The "key light," the
strongest light in a scene, was represented by highlighting the parts of the
cartoon character illuminated most strongly by this light.  "Fill lights," the
dimmer lights in a scene, also needed to be indicated, as did the areas of the
characters not being "struck" by light. <p>
The "tone mattes" that create this were the work of effects animators.  Bill
Perkins explains, "They create hard-edged black pieces of artwork that define
the lighter or darker areas on the character.  The black region dictates at a
later stage of compositing what kind of color is added to or taken out of that
area of the character to make it appear rounded.  So you'll have a piece of
black matte artwork that defines the brighter areas where light is striking a
character, and you'll have another that defines the darker area, where it's
more in shade."  The mattes themselves look like thick-lined, negative images
of the animated characters with some parts left out.<p>
"Each animated character," Wendy Aylsworth explains, "has multiple mattes drawn
over it to give it shadings."   The mattes were scanned into the Animo system,
exactly like the original animation, then laid over the colored animation
artwork to indicate the lightening and darkening of the colors of the
individual characters section.  
<a name="cinesite"></a>
<P><HR size=3 width=75%>
<P><B>ON TO CINESITE</B><br>
<br>
When all this work was done--entirely within the digital computer realm--it was
transmitted over a high speed network connection from the <i>Space Jam</i>
offices in Sherman Oaks to the offices of Cinesite, the computer visual-effects
and post-production company, in Hollywood.  <p>
Here, using Kodak's Cineon system, artists worked on the drawings even further
with compositing computers.  Digital effects producer Helen Elswit explains,
"We set up a 'hero shot'--in each scene, a specific shot is chosen so that the
art director, Bill Perkins, and I can sit down with the main compositor at the
computer and set the look for the scene.  For the most part, unless there is a
dramatic mood or lighting change in a scene, one hero shot is sufficient.  This
shot is then put out on film so that Ivan Reitman can give his approval.  Once
we have that hero established, Cinesite joins the process, taking the hero shot
and all the other shots from animation in that sequence, and builds the
scene."<p>
<P><IMG align=right src="img/tech/tech6.jpg" width=180 height=109 alt="Michael and Bugs" hspace=10>Cinesite vice president of production Mitzi Gallagher explains, "We found that
as we began adding live-action and animated characters to a scene, the initial
look needed to be adjusted to make sure that the right characters were
emphasized with no one blending into the background.  Our digital-effects
supervisors, Carlos Arguello and Doug Tubach, adjusted the brightness, the
colors, the tones and shadows, working with Ivan Reitman so that all the
various elements were consistent and accomplished the scene the way he
envisioned it throughout the scene."<p>
Cinesite went further, too.  They added depth to the backgrounds--buildings
"moved" further away, trees came closer, for example.  What would be called
"grad filters" with a real camera were also employed, allowing a given shot to
be darkened subtly around the edges, so that the viewer's eye will focus on the
highlighted center of the shot.  And they could manipulate the tone mattes
further as well, creating as many different layers of shading as desired.  <p>
"We break the tone mattes down into separate elements," Ed Jones explains,
"depending on whether they're on a cheek or on a body.  We can control the
density, the color, the amount of blur on the edge, depending on how we want to
light the character.  We are painting on film with the computer and we're
creating dimensionality, depending on whether the character is closer to the
camera or farther away.  The closer it is to the camera, the more it must be
modeled.  And then we can add motion blur, like a camera shutter would blur a
regular scene.  We can stylize how each of these animated characters looks."<p>
In traditional animation, these different layers represented by the flat art,
the backgrounds and the tone mattes, were literally that: layers of celluloid
with paint on them.  Going beyond five or six layers tended to bring out the
faint color of the celluloid itself, adding a yellowish, cloudy look to the
more layered sequences.  The famous "multiplane" of the Disney studios, which
used sheets of glass stacked like a colossal sandwich, was an effort to
overcome some of these problems, but it is a huge, cumbersome device used only
for the most spectacular scenes requiring many layers of depth.  <p>
By keeping all of the drawings in digital form (but easily shown on a video
screen), the Cineon operator can add as many layers of depth as the scene needs
without any loss of definition or addition of unwanted color whatsoever.  Tony
Cervone adds, "You could put ten thousand layers on this stuff, and it will do
nothing, it will never cloud up." <p>
Furthermore, with all the animation now loaded into the computers, the kind of
small errors that can creep in with so many people working on a project can
easily be corrected.  "Sometimes," says Wendy Aylsworth, "when we've got the
shots together, the perspective doesn't look right, or the sizing is off
because something went wrong in doing the rotoscopes (drawings based on moving
images).  Or perhaps a character was drawn too close, but should be further
into the background.  You can use the computer to completely re-size and
reposition any character, to make them fit into the scene correctly.  The
computer is used a lot for that, making sure everything's staying in
perspective."
<a name="court"></a>
<P><HR size=3 width=75%>
<P><B>ON THE BASKETBALL COURT</B>
<P>One problem that has always existed with cartoons is the sometimes wildly
shifting perspectives of a background.  If you are using a movie or video
camera, panning over any background behind the actors, if you examined the film
a frame at a time, you'd see that the background seems to distort a little--or a lot, if a wide-angle lens is used.  <p>
In conventional cartoons, this distortion has to be drawn in by hand on the
backgrounds.  For example, if the scene required a swift pan down a drainpipe
on the corner of a building, the artist had to draw a radically distorted
drainpipe: straw-thin at the top of the drawing, expanding to a big bulge in
the middle, tapering away to nothing again at the bottom.  The camera, moving
in a flat plane down this artwork, appeared to do a whip-pan down the side of
the building.  And don't forget the building: that, too, would have to be
carefully drawn in a distorted way to match the drainpipe.
<P><IMG align=left src="img/tech/tech7.jpg" width=180 height=109 alt="Sylvester and Granny" hspace=10>It takes the talents of both an artist and a mathematician to create this kind
of distortion, and it takes a lot of time.  <i>Space Jam</i>, surprisingly
enough, went from conception to finished product in one-third the time of a
normal animated feature-and yet it required more amazing shifts in perspective
than a normal animated feature.  <p>
Originally, the giant basketball stadium at the end was going to be raised up
above the basketball court, in an effort to overcome some of these perspective
problems, as well as to evade having to animate all the spectators.  But Ivan
Reitman and Joe Pytka bit the bullet: in a real NBA stadium, the seats come
right down to a few feet of the basketball court, so the stadium in <i>Space
Jam</i> required the same kind of seating.  These perspectives were going to
have to shift, and there were going to be thousands of animated spectators.  <p>
Cinesite found the solutions to these problems, as well as how to incorporate
Pytka's swirling camera moves.  The first big basketball scene in <i>Space
Jam</i> is set in a practice gym, where Michael Jordan learns just how inept
the Looney Tunes characters are when it comes to dribbling and slam-dunking.
The walls and floors of the gym are entirely created within the computer; all
Michael Jordan saw was that sea of green, and guys in green suits.  <p>
Animation layout artists designed the practice gym and designers at Cinesite
created a computer model of that gym, first in what's known as a "wire frame."
This simply means that what you'd see on the computer screen is the gym as if
it were made of thin white wires only, stark against a black background.<p>
Meanwhile, the scenes of Michael Jordan and the green Groundlings in the green
court were digitized, and all the green dropped out, which took away everything
except Michael Jordan, the basketball, and the hoop, net and backboard.  He
seemed to be playing basketball against invisible opponents in a black limbo.
<p>
But don't forget those red dots: they were uniformly spaced around the room in
a four-foot grid.  Much as graph paper is used to plot curves, the computer
could remember precisely the location of each of those balls.  When this
information was applied to the 3-D wire frame of the practice gym, the computer
could move the wire frame about in "virtual space" in ways that precisely
matched the live camera of director Joe Pytka.  The moves of the camera drove
the movements of the gym itself.<p>
This was added to the footage of Michael Jordan--all in digital space,
maintaining perfect resolution--and he seemed to be playing basketball now in a
gym made of white lines on a black background.  Now this footage was printed a
frame at a time onto "photo rotos" and sent back to the animators in Sherman
Oaks.  They could see Michael Jordan's precise location, and where the green
Groundlings were; they could then place the animated characters exactly where
they needed to be, a frame at a time.  The animators didn't have to follow the
movements of the green Groundlings exactly, because even a crouching real live
person doesn't have the same dimensions as Daffy Duck.  <p>
The process described above was again applied, this time to the footage of
Michael Jordan and the Looney Tunes characters working out in the practice
gym--playing basketball.  The ball is real when Michael Jordan is touching it,
but had to be put into some form of animation when Bugs and his buddies control
it.  However, no matter what form it's in, it's no ordinary ball, and here's
why:<p>
Joe Pytka is a major basketball fan; one of his most treasured possessions is a
scuffed old ball that has been touched by many of the greatest basketball
players who ever lived.  Ed Jones and his crew managed to sneak the ball away
from Pytka, and scanned it from every possible angle into the computer.  <p>
Now in computer-graphics form, the ball could be animated to do anything they
wanted, so that whenever Jordan is holding the ball, or it's bouncing off the
rim or swishing through the net, it's real.  When Elmer Fudd dribbles it down
the court and passes it to Yosemite Sam, it's computer animation of Pytka's
beloved ball. <p>
That ball bounces about on the court of a giant stadium, rendered in "3-D"
computer graphics.  Ed Jones and the team at Cinesite did everything they could
to make the stadium look as real as possible: the floor has a polished sheen,
the overhead lights occasionally make (computer-realized) "lens flares," and
the lighting on the audience is blotchy in the way it is in real life.  All
this is complex, but these days, is not particularly difficult for talented
computer artists to create. 
<a name="bleachers"></a>
<P><HR size=3 width=75%>
<P><B>FILLING THE BLEACHERS</B>
<P><IMG align=right src="img/tech/tech8.jpg" width=180 height=109 alt="Elmer, Porky, and Yosemite Sam" hspace=10>What was hard was the audience itself.  This sequence takes place in the land
beneath the ground where the Looney Tunes characters live, so the audience had
to be entirely cartoon characters--twenty-five thousand of them.  While Bill
Perkins and others at Warner Bros.' Sherman Oaks studio could provide Cinesite
with strips of Looney Tunes characters, animating so many characters was,
flatly, impossible.  <p>
They overcame the problem with startling ingenuity.  First, Cinesite simply
duplicated some of those characters in their computers and scattered about the
auditorium; their coloration could be changed, but there were still limitations
in doing it this way: an entire squad of, say, kilt-wearing Scotsmen (one of
Bugs' old opponents) would certainly not go unnoticed, even if some of them
wore paisley kilts. <p>
Ed Jones hit upon the idea of filming real people, some in bizarre
costumes--there's a guy wearing a spotted cow suit, for example--others in
regular clothing that's in bright, primary, cartoon colors.  Some of these
people wore generic "cartoon" heads, others wore the heads of specific
characters.  Then these were scanned digitally into the computer, manipulated
there in any number of ways: in terms of color, size, whether they're standing
and cheering or sitting and applauding, how far they are from the "camera's"
position, and so forth.  "We've mixed and matched all these characters," Jones
explains, "mostly for the front rows.  The audience is still going to see the
motion in the back rows as they look up there.  The crowd is part of the
environment." <p>
Occasionally, the Sherman Oaks team animated a specific portion of the stands
to highlight a cartoon-animated figure (watch for the bull from "Bully for
Bugs," for example).  By these means, the handful of live-action people and the
strips of cartoon animation multiplied over and over until they became a
cheering throng of cartoon characters.<p>
New technologies are created to solve old problems, but sometimes those new
technologies can create problems of their own--and as always, it is up to human
ingenuity to solve them.  For example, while shooting in the all-green set,
occasionally one of the green Groundlings passed briefly in front of, say,
Michael Jordan's leg, a quick move that went unnoticed at first.  But since the
green all went away, that meant that part of Jordan's leg hidden by the green
guy also went away.  Co-directors of animation Bruce Smith and Tony Cervone
went over every day's work in a "sweat box" session, and when they'd spot a bit
of Michael disappearing, they knew that it was time to have, say, Sylvester
chase Tweety Bird through the scene, hiding that momentary loss of Jordan's
body.

<P><B>DISTORTING MICHAEL JORDAN</B><br>
<br> 
And speaking of Michael Jordan's body, thanks to Cinesite, he gets battered and
transformed as much as any of the animated characters.  "When Michael is first
introduced into looney Tunes Land," Ed Jones explains, "he's playing a golf
game, and gets zipped down a hole.  We shot two plates [scenes to which effects
are added] on location, one of Michael bending over, and one with just the golf
green.  Michael pantomimed going down the hole, and then we built a 3-D
Michael."  <p>
This wasn't some Frankensteinian experiment, but a matter of scanning Michael
and storing his digital image in a computer.  This enabled Cinesite to
manipulate the footage of Jordan in exactly the same way as any other artwork:
Michael could be stretched, squashed, and even wadded up into the shape of a
basketball. <p>
"We added other magic, too," Jones grins.  "When Bugs kisses Michael, we
altered Michael's lips a little--stretched them out a little as Bugs' lips come
back out.  There are times when Bugs is tapping Michael, so we added
indentations into Michael's clothing from Bugs' fingers.  This is for the
laserdisc collector, who can stop on a frame and see all our tricks."<p>
Not only does Michael Jordan plunge literally headfirst into the world of the
animated Looney Tunes characters, but Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck venture out
into the real world to retrieve Michael's basketball and his uniform.  Again,
green Groundlings were used, but this time they were shot in a realistic set of
Michael's office rather than a green background.  However, they were dropped
out in the same way as though they had been shot on a green stage, and Bugs and
Daffy were added where appropriate.<p>
At one point, one of the character rummages through a drawer; the team shot
this twice, once with the green Groundling going through this action, and once
a simple plate of the same set of drawers with no one there.  "In that case,"
digital effects producer Helen Elswit explains, "animation didn't have to cover
the green guy.  Artists could use it to draw in their animation while having
the background fully visible.  They were able to remove the green guy and still
see what was behind him.  Animators could be as free as they wanted, because
they didn't have to worry about filling the space left when the green guy was
removed on the computer."

<P><B>THE ARTIST IS IN THE SYSTEM</B><br>
<br>
All of the various elements of <i>Space Jam</i> gradually made their way into
the computer systems at Cinesite, until the entire film existed there.  When it
came time to turn it into actual film, the computer was involved as well.  With
other computer animation systems, a very high resolution monitor is simply
photographed by an appropriate camera, but with Cineon, there's no camera
involved at all.  A system of lasers is used to transfer the computer image
directly onto film. 	<p>
One of the classic fears about computers has always been that they would wipe
out jobs, making artisans, workers and even artists obsolete.  But that's
simply not happening.  As Bruce Smith says, "I think the computer has always
been intended to be an aid to the artist, and not necessarily to replace him.
In this instance, we totally manipulated the computer for our use.  It frees us
up from the highly technical aspects that have to be believable in the way we
make films today." <p>
Producer Ivan Reitman marvels at the achievements that have brought <i>Space
Jam </i>from concept to dazzling reality in such a short time, but he is
realistic about the role of technology in creating a motion picture, animated
or not.  "Technology will never take the place of those creative skills that
lead producers, directors and writers to make movies in the first place.  A
word processor doesn't make a novelist any more than a synthesizer makes a
composer.  <p>
"Despite all the technological advances in animation, the quality of the
production is still totally dependent on the skills of the artists.  Computers
are simply the latest tools available to help them bring their vision to
reality.  No hardware or software will ever replace human creativity."<p>
