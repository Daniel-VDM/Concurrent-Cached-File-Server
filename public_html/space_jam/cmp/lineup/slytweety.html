<b>Tweety &amp; Sylvester</b><p>

It was in a Merrie Melodie called <i>Tweetie Pie</i>, directed by Friz Freleng
and released in 1947, that this endearing and enduring pair was first teamed,
demonstrating that their cat-and-bird game was irresistible to audiences,
bringing home the first of the Warner cartoonists' Academy Awards, and kicking
off a series that would run until the studio closed, and then beyond.  In 42
animated adventures (all but one directed by Freleng) this baby-talking bird
who just bordered on the precious proved that he was not above using pins,
needles, tacks, darts, saws, shovels, mallets, anvils, anchors, barbed wire,
chemicals, roller skates, bowling balls, baseball bats, seltzer bottles, boxing
gloves, vicious dogs, lions, Bengal tigers, sharks, firearms, blowtorches,
dynamite, skyrockets, or cannons, if the need arose, to ward off the
threatening "puddy tat."<p>

Tweety and Sylvester were separate comedians who found they created a unique
kind of spontaneous combustion when they called themselves a team.  Tweety, in
fact, was created to star opposite an Abbott &amp; Costello caricature:  a pair
of mangy parody cats named "Babbit &amp; Catstello," in Bob Clampett's <i>A
Tale of Two Kitties</i> in 1942.  In this first cartoon, he greets the
discovery of his unsuspecting predators with the line that would become his
trademark:  "I tawt I taw a puddy tat!"<p>

Sylvester's birth occurred three years later in a Freleng cartoon entitled
<i>Life with Feathers</i>.  "I designed Sylvester to look subtly like a clown,"
Freleng later explained.  "I gave him a big red nose and a very low crotch,
which was supposed to look like he was wearing baggy pants.  But gradually he
was changed, because the construction restricted his animation."<p>

As a team, Sylvester and Tweety found their origins in the Bugs Bunny mystique
that held the studio in its grip:  the constant search for more characters to
act out the eternal tug-of-war between the Innocent in implicit (and complicit)
harmony with the Universe At Large, and the Adversary who just can't get the
hang of it.  Like Bugs and the Road Runner, Tweety could do no wrong;  like
Yosemite Sam and Wile E. Coyote, Sylvester could do no right.  Between the two
of them, they cleaned up.<p>
