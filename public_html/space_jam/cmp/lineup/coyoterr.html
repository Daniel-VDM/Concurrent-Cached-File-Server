<b>Road Runner &amp; Coyote</b><p>

In the late `40s, storyman Michael Maltese and director Chuck Jones were
searching for the right combination of far-out animals to populate the cartoon
they envisioned as a parody of the constant chases that had come to dominate
animation.  They finally settled on an emaciated Coyote chasing a supersonic
Road Runner and got it on the screen in <i>Fast and Furry-ous</i> in 1949.
Audiences laughed, but no one saw it as a parody of anything.  So for 15 years,
Maltese and Jones had to content themselves with turning out one of the most
popular series of cartoons ever made.<p>

Most of us, having attempted to capture a roadrunner two or three times and
failed, would give up and go chase a rabbit.  But Wile E. Coyote is earnestly
trying to prove to himself that such a thing is possible for him.  And he has
somehow gotten the idea that since simple schemes don't work, complicated ones
must be the answer.  <p>

Yet all he proves is that the more elaborate his preparations, the greater the
chances of something going wrong, so that his obsession proves his undoing over
and over.  There he is, staring at the dynamite, watching the impending
onslaught of arrows, or, worst of all, sailing off one of those ubiquitous
5-mile cliffs, with nothing to do but submit to his fate--then go on with
the next scheme, momentarily restored by the fadeout, pretending none of this
has happened.<p>
