<b>Porky</b><p>

The first of the familiar Warners Cartoon stars was Mr. Porcine "Porky"
Pig.  Porky emerged a star from Friz Freleng's<b><i> I Haven't Got a
Hat</i></b> as early as 1935.  According to Director Freleng, "When I was a
kid, I had two playmates--a little fat kid called Piggy and his younger brother, who was called Porky.  I always wanted to do a comic strip with two kids with those names.  But in animation, everything is animals, so when I had this classroom cartoon, I thought of Porky."<p>

Friz Freleng saud,  "We were searching for a new character,and the audience
told us Porky was the guy."<p>
