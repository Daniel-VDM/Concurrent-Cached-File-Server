<b>Daffy</b><p>

<b></b>The only major Warner Bros. cartoon stars to be established
<b>before</b> Bugs, rather than in the wake of his success were Daffy Duck and
Porky Pig.  Daffy started life as the target of a hunter's rifle, just as Bugs
did, and became a comedian through a totally unexpected reaction to that
fact.<p>

The film was <i>Porky's Duck Hunt</i>.  A hunter himself, Avery thought it
would be funny if one of Nature's Own turned the tables on his oppressor, and
he created a screwball duck who <b>didn't</b> get scared and run away when
somebody pointed a gun at him, but leapt and hopped all over the place like a
maniac.  In his best scene, the screwball duck does nothing more than dance
away over a lake, in one long, mad shot--no camera movement, no great dialogue,
just "Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo, Hoo-Hoo!," hopping on the water, turning handsprings,
bouncing on his head, tumbling in the air, sidling on his heel, splashing on
the surface, skidding far out of sight, and then swooping back again for
another round.<p>

"...When it hit the theaters," remembered Bob Clampett, who animated the scene,
"it was like an explosion."<p>

From this point on, the Warner Cartoon Studio had not only a concept but also a
character:  henceforth, its Looney Tunes would be Looney and its Duck would be
Daffy.<p>

Like Bugs, he needed to grow, to mature, to <b>develop</b> from this elemental
debut, before he could realize his full potential.  But he never lost the
insanity he showed in his first cartoon.  Instead, he would become a parody of
himself;  Daffy went on to become the lunatic fringe of his own cartoons, just
as Bugs became the moral center of his. <p>
