<b>"Taz"</b><p>

<b></b>The <b>youngest</b> and, according to some, the most exciting of the
Warner Bros. classic cartoon characters is Bugs' most mindless, most ferocious
antagonist, The Tasmanian Devil.  Baroque enough that there should <b>be</b>
such a cartoon character as a Tasmanian Devil;  a name would just be excess
baggage.<p>

Taz has now become one of the most popular in the entire Looney Tunes gallery.
He was literally thrown away when Warner supervisor Ed Selzer forbade his
director, Bob McKimson, to bring him back for any more encores after his
premiere appearance in <i>Devil May Hare</i> in 1954.  But when Jack Warner
started to miss the little Devil, and ask when he was going to show up again,
Selzer had to rescind that order.<p>

When Mel Blanc began to develop a voice for this new character, he asked, all
innocence, "What does he sound like?" and was told, "Nobody has ever heard
one."  So he was compelled to ad-lib some kind of glottal-guttural gravelly
gargle,  now lovingly described as "Taz-speak."<p>
